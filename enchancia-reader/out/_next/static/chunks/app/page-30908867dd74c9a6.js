Officers moved with the hushed urgency of people who knew they were handling something above their pay grade. Somewhere inside the manor, someone was crying — a raw, terrible sound that carried through an open window and died in the morning air.\n\n"Mr. Blanc." The local detective extended a hand. His name tag read HENDRICKS. He had the look of a man who\'d been up all night and wished he hadn\'t been. "I appreciate you coming, but I\'ll be honest — I\'m not sure why you did. We have a confession. Case is closed."\n\n"So I\'ve been told."\n\n"One of the guests. A writer. Name of Chase Matthews." Hendricks pulled out a notebook. "Walked into the station at six this morning, hadn\'t slept, looked like hell. Said he killed her. Said he\'d been watching her for days. Said he was obsessed with her." He flipped a page. "We pulled his record. Sealed juvenile stuff, but we got a judge to open it. Restraining order from six years ago. A girl named Zoey Brooks. Same pattern — obsessive behavior, surveillance, stalking. He\'s got a type, apparently."\n\nBenoit Blanc\'s gaze drifted up to the balcony — old ironwork, partially detached from the stone, a gap where a railing should have been. "He confessed to tampering with the railing?"\n\n"He knew details we hadn\'t released. The bolts. How many were loosened. The time of death, down to the half hour." Hendricks shrugged. "He says he was watching her that night. Saw her on the balcony. Saw the railing give way. Says he could have stopped it but didn\'t."\n\n"And you believe him."\n\n"I believe evidence, Mr. Blanc. And the evidence says he was there, he was obsessed, and he knew things only the killer would know." Hendricks tucked the notebook away. "So like I said — I\'m not sure why you\'re here. We\'ve got our man."\n\nBlanc was quiet for a moment, his eyes still on the balcony.\n\n"I received a phone call last night," he said. "Very late. A woman\'s voice. No name given, no number traced. She said only: \'The writer didn\'t do it. Come see for yourself.\'"\n\n"An anonymous tip." Hendricks didn\'t hide his skepticism. "You came all this way because of an anonymous tip."\n\n"Now, an anonymous tip is a curious thing." Blanc turned to face him, hands clasped behind his back. "It is either the desperate misdirection of a guilty party, or the desperate truth-telling of someone who cannot speak openly. Either way, it suggests that someone at this estate believes the story is not yet finished." He paused, the faintest smile crossing his face. "And an unfinished story, Detective Hendricks, is an invitation I cannot refuse."\n\nHendricks stared at him for a long moment. Then he sighed. "Fine. You want to poke around, poke around. But Matthews is our guy. I\'d bet my pension on it."\n\n"I never bet," Blanc said mildly. "Betting requires certainty. I prefer to wonder." He looked up at the manor — the climbing ivy, the old stone, the windows catching the morning light. A beautiful place. A terrible thing had happened here. "Now. Tell me about the other guests. All of them."'},{id:2,title:"Derek",subtitle:"Three Days Earlier",unlockTime:h.getTime()+864e5,content:'The black SUV took the curve too fast, sprayed gravel across the lawn, and skidded to a stop at an angle that blocked half the drive.\n\nThe driver\'s door flew open before the engine had fully died. Derek Turnbow didn\'t believe in speed limits, especially not on private property that wasn\'t his, and he definitely didn\'t believe in parking straight.\n\n"Jesus, Derek." His uncle Ray climbed out of the passenger side, one hand on the dashboard for support. "You drive like you\'re being chased."\n\n"Maybe I am. Maybe there\'s a ghost car. You don\'t know."\n\n"There\'s not a ghost car."\n\n"You don\'t *know*."\n\nRay shook his head, but he was smiling — the patient, slightly weary smile of a man who\'d spent two hours in a car with his nephew. He pulled a duffel bag from the back seat while Derek was already striding toward the manor house, scanning the front of the estate with the expression of someone looking for something to complain about.\n\nThe manor rose before him, all old stone and climbing ivy and windows that caught the afternoon light. It looked like money. Old money. The kind of money that came with history and responsibility and a lot of boring conversations about "legacy."\n\nDerek hated it on principle. His own family had money too, but theirs was different. Turnbow money came from land deals and development projects and things that happened in conference rooms. Not from... whatever this was. Philanthropy. Conservation. Words that made his father\'s lip curl.\n\n"This place looks like a museum threw up," he announced to no one in particular. "Or a mausoleum. Whatever. Where\'s the—"\n\n"Derek!"\n\nA woman was descending the front steps, and even Derek — who made a point of being unimpressed by everything — had to admit she didn\'t move like most people. There was something in the way Sofia carried herself: straight-backed but not stiff, confident but not arrogant, like someone who\'d learned to wear authority as comfortably as a favorite sweater.\n\nShe was smiling. That was the annoying thing about Sofia. She was always smiling, and it always looked real.\n\n"You made it," she said, reaching the bottom of the steps and opening her arms.\n\n"Obviously." He let her hug him, holding himself rigid for approximately half a second before something in his shoulders loosened and he almost — almost — hugged her back. "Traffic was stupid. Roads were stupid. The whole drive was basically torture."\n\n"It was two hours."\n\n"Two hours of Uncle Ray asking about real estate prices out here. Like I know anything about real estate prices." He pulled back, already scanning the front of the house again. "You got food here? Actual food? Or is it all fancy stuff with foam on it?"\n\n"I had them stock the refrigerator with Hot Pockets specifically for you."\n\nDerek stopped scanning. His face did something complicated — a flicker of surprise, quickly smothered by practiced indifference, then something that might have been genuine pleasure before the mask slammed back down.\n\n"That\'s... fine, I guess. Whatever." He grabbed his backpack from the car. "Which way\'s the kitchen?"\n\n"Through the main hall, take a left at the library, down the corridor past the—"\n\n"I\'ll find it." He was already walking. "Later."\n\nBehind him, Ray had reached the front steps, duffel bag over his shoulder. "Sorry about him," he said to Sofia, with a self-deprecating shrug. "I tried to teach him manners on the drive. Didn\'t take."\n\nSofia laughed. "I\'ve stopped trying. It\'s part of his charm."\n\nSofia watched Derek disappear around a corner, her smile softening into something fonder. She\'d have to find him later. Make sure he actually ate something other than Hot Pockets. Make sure he knew he was welcome here, even though he\'d never admit to caring about that.\n\nBut first: the other guests would be arriving soon, and Sofia had a long weekend ahead of her.'},{id:3,title:"Ellen",subtitle:"Three Days Earlier",unlockTime:h.getTime()+1728e5,content:'The second car arrived at exactly 3:47 PM.\n\nEllen Baker pulled her sensible minivan into the circular drive with the careful precision of someone who had definitely researched the estate\'s arrival procedures in advance — and who was now experiencing significant distress about being three minutes ahead of her own schedule.\n\n"Three minutes early," she muttered, putting the car in park. "That\'s basically late. That\'s basically disrespectful."\n\nShe was still cataloging her failures when she stepped out of the vehicle and saw the black SUV parked at an angle that blocked nearly half the drive.\n\nEllen stared at it.\n\nShe stared at the angle.\n\nShe stared at the way it was forcing all other vehicles to navigate around it like some kind of automotive obstacle course.\n\nSomething behind her eyes began to twitch.\n\n"That\'s fine," she said out loud, to no one. "That\'s totally fine. Some people just... park like that. In the middle of things. Blocking access. For everyone."\n\nShe said "that\'s fine" three more times while unloading her suitcases, which took a while because there were three of them, plus a cooler bag, plus a tote of emergency supplies, plus a garment bag containing three different outfit options for tomorrow\'s announcement because she hadn\'t been able to decide which one struck the right balance between "supportive friend" and "not trying to upstage anyone."\n\n"Ellen!" Sofia appeared at the top of the steps, descending with arms open. "You made it!"\n\n"I\'m three minutes early, which is basically late, and I\'m so sorry, there was traffic on Route 7 that I should have accounted for—"\n\n"You\'re exactly on time. You\'re perfect. Stop apologizing."\n\n"I brought backup napkins." The words tumbled out before Ellen could stop them. "And appetizers. And a secondary centerpiece in case the primary centerpiece has issues. And I have thoughts about the seating arrangement, but I don\'t want to overstep, so I wrote them down in a memo instead of saying them out loud, except now I\'m saying them out loud, which defeats the purpose—"\n\n"Ellen."\n\n"Yes?"\n\n"Breathe."\n\nEllen breathed. Her hands moved as she did it — not quite sign language, but the ghost of it, the muscle memory of two decades of communicating with her deaf husband bleeding into her gestures even when he wasn\'t present. A self-soothing tic. A way of grounding herself.\n\n"Sorry," she said. "I just want this weekend to be perfect for you. This announcement is such a big deal, and I want to help. I need to help. If I\'m not helping, I\'m just sitting there being useless, and if I\'m sitting there being useless, I start thinking, and if I start thinking—"\n\n"You reorganize the furniture in your mind?"\n\n"I reorganized my hotel room twice before I came here." Ellen\'s voice dropped to a confessional whisper. "They don\'t stack their towels by size, Sofia. They just fold them. In a pile. No system."\n\nSofia\'s expression was somewhere between sympathy and deep affection. "The horror."\n\n"I know you\'re teasing me. But yes."\n\n"Come inside. I\'ll show you the kitchen setup." Sofia took one of her suitcases — Ellen protested, then relented, then tried to take it back, then gave up. "I have a feeling you\'re going to have opinions."\n\n"I have so many opinions." Ellen grabbed her remaining bags and followed. "About the appetizer timing and the wine selection and the breakfast service and also I noticed that SUV blocking the driveway and I just want you to know that I\'m not going to say anything about it but it\'s definitely a hazard — and there was a man getting luggage out of it who I didn\'t recognize, is he on the guest list? Because I don\'t have him on the guest list, and I need to know about these things so I can adjust the seating chart—"\n\n"That\'s Derek\'s uncle. He came along last minute."\n\n"Last minute." Ellen\'s left eye twitched, almost imperceptibly. "That\'s fine. That\'s totally fine. I\'ll just... adjust. I\'m very good at adjusting. Do you have a master key, by the way? For the guest rooms? In case of emergencies? I should probably have one. For emergencies."\n\nSofia hesitated, just for a moment. "I\'ll have one made for you."\n\n"Thank you. I\'ll keep track of everything. I always do."\n\nThey disappeared into the house, Ellen already asking about the layout, the schedule, who was staying in which wing.

Gravel is basically tiny rocks. Rocks are very sturdy.\"\n\n\"It's got dirt on it.\"\n\n\"That's— I mean, technically—\"\n\n\"I don't do dirt.\"\n\nAnd so Chase walked.\n\nThis was fine, actually. He was a walker. He thought best while walking — something about the rhythm of movement that loosened thoughts, let them flow from wherever they'd been stuck. Some of his best story ideas had come to him on long, rambling walks through cities and parks and once, memorably, through an IKEA at 2 AM.\n\nThe problem was that walking also gave him time to think about her.\n\nSofia.\n\nHe'd met her once before — fourteen months ago, a thirty-minute interview for a short piece in the *Tribune*. She'd been patient with his nervous questions, laughed at a joke he hadn't meant to make, and at the end she'd said, \"You're a good listener, Chase. That's rare.\"\n\nNobody had ever said that to him before. Nobody had ever looked at him the way she had — like he was worth paying attention to.\n\nHe'd been thinking about her ever since.\n\nHe'd requested this assignment. Told his editor it was because of the conservation angle, because of the announcement, because it was an important story. That was a lie. The truth was he'd been tracking Sofia's public appearances for over a year. He'd read every interview she'd given. He'd studied photos of Enchancia Manor until he could navigate it in his dreams. He knew which balcony was hers — the one off the private study, east-facing — because he'd found the floor plans in an old architectural magazine.\n\n*For the profile*, he told himself. *It's research. It's what writers do.*\n\nBut he knew that wasn't entirely true. He knew because he'd told himself the same thing before.\n\nAfter what happened with Zoey — after the restraining order, after the lawyers, after his parents looking at him like they didn't recognize him anymore — he'd sworn he would never let himself fall into that pattern again. He would be professional. He would maintain boundaries. He would not confuse admiration for something else.\n\nAnd then Sofia had said *you're a good listener*, and he'd felt that familiar pull in his chest like a hook being set.\n\nHe was so deep in this spiral that he didn't notice the front steps until he was falling up them.\n\n\"Whoa—\"\n\nHis messenger bag swung forward, his feet tangled with his own ankles, and he performed a sort of controlled collapse that ended with him on his hands and knees on the second step, notebooks scattering, pen rolling away toward what appeared to be a very expensive planter.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" he said to the steps. \"That was my fault. I wasn't looking where I was—\"\n\nHe stopped, realizing he was apologizing to architecture.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nSofia was standing at the top of the steps, and she was smiling — that same warm, genuine smile from fourteen months ago. The one he'd been replaying in his mind ever since.\n\n\"Chase Matthews,\" she said. \"Still apologizing to inanimate objects?\"\n\nHis heart stopped. She remembered. She remembered *him*.\n\n\"They deserve it,\" he managed. \"The steps, I mean. I've been very rude to them.\"\n\nHe gathered his notebooks, hands trembling slightly. One of them had fallen open — pages of cramped handwriting, observations, timestamps. Research he'd done from afar, schedules he'd reconstructed from her social media, details he'd memorized from every interview she'd ever given. If she saw it, if she looked closely—\n\nHe snapped it shut and stood up, brushing himself off.\n\n\"Thank you for having me,\" he said. \"For the profile. I know you're busy, and this is a big week for you, and I really appreciate—\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're here.\" She descended the steps toward him, and he caught the faint scent of her shampoo — the same one from fourteen months ago, he'd looked it up after their interview, jasmine and something else he couldn't name. \"I read the *Tribune* piece. You were fair. That matters.\"\n\n*Fair*. He'd written and rewritten that piece forty-seven times, obsessing over every word, terrified of disappointing her. And she'd called it *fair*.\n\n\"Would you like to come inside?\" she asked. \"The others are already here. Dinner's at seven.\"\n\n\"That would be great. Yes. Thank you.\"\n\nHe followed her inside, close enough to count the freckles on the back of her neck — *stop it stop it stop it* — and only tripped twice on the threshold."},{id:5,title:"Tori & Summer",subtitle:"Three Days Earlier",unlockTime:h.getTime()+3456e5,content:'The fourth guest arrived in a town car with tinted windows and a driver who actually got out to open the door.\n\nDerek was watching from a second-floor window, Hot Pocket in hand, when the car pulled up. He\'d found a vantage point that let him see the entire approach — not because he cared about the other guests, but because people-watching was more interesting than the book Ellen had tried to give him about "the history of conservation in North America."\n\n"Who\'s this?" he muttered.\n\nThe door opened, and a woman emerged.\n\nShe did it wrong, which was the first thing Derek noticed. Or rather, she did it too *right* — one leg, then the other, then a smooth rise that looked like it had been practiced in front of a mirror. Her clothes were the kind of casual that cost more than formal, and her hair was doing that thing where it looked effortless but definitely wasn\'t.\n\nDerek knew performative confidence when he saw it. He lived in a family built on it.\n\n"Great," he said to no one. "Another one."\n\nBelow, Tori Vega was already in motion — hugging Sofia, exclaiming over the property, saying all the right things in all the right ways. Even from this distance, Derek could see the way her eyes kept drifting to the surroundings, calculating angles, assessing lighting.\n\nHe\'d done exactly three minutes of research on the other guests (Derek\'s attention span for research being approximately three minutes), and he knew Tori was some kind of performer. Singer, actress, foundation ambassador. The kind of person who was always working, always networking, always *on*.\n\nDerek finished his Hot Pocket and decided he didn\'t like her.\n\nThis was unfair, possibly, given that he hadn\'t actually met her yet. But Derek had never let fairness get in the way of a strong opinion.\n\nBelow, Tori was saying something that made Sofia laugh — a polite laugh, not the real kind — and then they were heading inside together, Tori\'s arm linked through Sofia\'s, her voice carrying up through the open window in fragments.\n\n"...so excited to be here..."\n\n"...the foundation work has been so rewarding..."\n\n"...any chance I could get a peek at the schedule for tomorrow? Just so I know where to..."\n\nThe rest was lost as they disappeared through the front door. But Derek had caught something in Tori\'s voice — a tension underneath the brightness, like a guitar string wound too tight. She wanted that schedule for a reason. People didn\'t ask questions like that unless they were planning something.\n\nDerek turned from the window and tossed his Hot Pocket wrapper toward a trash can. Missed. Considered picking it up. Decided against it.\n\nThat was basically his philosophy about most things.\n\n---\n\nThe fifth guest was already there when the others arrived.\n\nSummer Roberts had shown up a day early, because Summer Roberts didn\'t wait for things to start — she started them. She\'d spent the morning reorganizing Sofia\'s foundation files ("Your system is chaos, babe"), the afternoon arguing with the caterer about the wine selection ("Nobody drinks Riesling at a conservation announcement, are you insane?"), and was now standing on the front steps watching Tori Vega\'s town car pull away.\n\n"Who was that?" she asked, not looking at Sofia.\n\n"Tori. The foundation ambassador. You\'ve met her."\n\n"The singer who\'s always taking selfies at our events?"\n\n"She\'s been very good for awareness."\n\n"Awareness." Summer said the word like it tasted bad. "Right."\n\nShe turned to face Sofia, and her expression shifted — the sharp edges softening into something more vulnerable. "You look tired. Have you slept?"\n\n"I\'ll sleep after the announcement."\n\n"Sofia—"\n\n"I\'m fine."\n\n"You\'re not fine. You called me at 2 AM last week talking about shell companies and forensic accountants. That\'s not fine. That\'s—" Summer stopped herself. Glanced around the grounds. "We shouldn\'t talk about this out here."\n\n"We shouldn\'t talk about it at all. Not yet."\n\n"I still think you\'re making a mistake. Going public before going to the authorities—"\n\n"I want witnesses." Sofia\'s voice was quiet but final. "I want everyone to see. I want there to be no possibility of this getting buried."\n\nSummer stared at her for a long moment. "You know what happened to the last person who tried to expose something like this? In my world?"\n\n"This isn\'t Newport."\n\n"No. It\'s worse." Summer\'s jaw tightened. "At least in Newport they just destroy your reputation. Here—"\n\n"Summer."\n\n"Fine. Fine." She held up her hands in surrender. "But if you get yourself killed over some land deal, I\'m going to be really pissed at you."\n\nSofia laughed — a real laugh, tired but genuine. "Noted."\n\n"Also, that Chase guy has been taking notes on everyone since he got here. Like, creepy notes. He was watching the parking area from his window for twenty minutes."\n\n"He\'s a writer. He\'s supposed to observe."\n\n"There\'s observing, and there\'s surveillance." Summer shrugged. "I\'m just saying. Something\'s off about him."'},{id:6,title:"Dinner",subtitle:"That Evening",unlockTime:h.getTime()+432e6,content:'Dinner was at seven, in the small dining room Sofia had converted from a formal banquet hall into something that actually encouraged conversation. Round table instead of long. Warm lighting instead of chandeliers. The kind of space where people could talk without shouting across an acre of mahogany.\n\nEllen had arranged the seating four times before settling on a configuration she described as "optimal for conversational flow." Sofia was at the host position, with Derek on her left and Tori on her right. Chase sat next to Derek, notebook already out, scribbling observations between bites. Ellen had placed herself next to Tori, close enough to monitor the centerpiece for signs of instability. Summer sat across from Sofia, her eyes moving around the table with the sharp assessment of someone cataloging threats. Ray had taken the seat nearest the kitchen — "in case anyone needs anything," he\'d said, though no one had asked.\n\n"So," Tori said, twenty minutes into the meal, "tomorrow\'s the big day." She was cutting her salmon into perfectly equal portions, each motion precise and deliberate. "The announcement that\'s going to change everything. Any hints?"\n\n"It\'s about land," Sofia said.\n\n"Well, yes, obviously." Tori\'s laugh was musical, practiced. "The whole foundation is about land. Can you be more specific?"\n\n"It\'s about protecting it."\n\n"From?"\n\nSofia set down her fork.\n\nThe motion was small, but something in the room shifted — a subtle change in the quality of attention. Ellen paused mid-adjustment of a napkin. Derek stopped dismantling his bread roll. Ray was quietly buttering a piece of bread, not looking up. Even Chase\'s pen, which had been moving steadily across his notebook, went still. Summer caught Sofia\'s eye and gave a small shake of her head — *don\'t*.\n\n"From people who would exploit it," Sofia said. Her voice was calm, but there was something underneath it now. A firmness. A quiet steel. "From people who see land and think only about what they can take from it. From people who would destroy something irreplaceable for short-term profit."\n\nTori\'s smile flickered, uncertain. Ellen\'s hands went still on her napkin. Derek looked up sharply — for once, not with a joke ready. Chase wrote something in his notebook, underlined it. Summer\'s jaw tightened.\n\n"That sounds intense," Derek said, breaking the silence. "Also, this salmon is dry."\n\nThe tension dissolved. Ellen began apologizing for the salmon even though she hadn\'t cooked it. Tori smoothly redirected the conversation toward foundation fundraising strategies. Summer signaled a waiter for more wine. Ray asked Ellen about her kitchen renovation plans, and she launched into a detailed description of cabinet options that lasted through dessert.'},{id:7,title:"Midnight",subtitle:"Later That Night",unlockTime:h.getTime()+5184e5,content:"Later that night, Sofia sat alone in her study.\n\nThe manor was quiet around her — that particular kind of quiet that old houses held after midnight, full of settling sounds and distant creaks. The building slowly exhaling after a long day.\n\nOn the desk in front of her was a folder.\n\nShe'd received it three days ago from the forensic accountant she'd hired six months earlier. Six months of following money through shell companies and offshore accounts and corporate structures designed to obscure who was buying what and from whom.\n\nShe opened it now, for perhaps the hundredth time.\n\nThe documents inside told a story. Grant money from the conservation foundation, flowing through intermediary accounts, ending up in the coffers of a real estate development company. Land rights purchased in areas that were supposed to be protected. Information about foundation strategy leaked to outside parties.\n\nSomeone close to her had been betraying everything she'd built.\n\nShe turned to the final page. The signatures. The real names behind the corporate shells.\n\nShe'd known, intellectually, that the investigation might lead somewhere painful. She'd prepared herself for the possibility that the betrayer might be someone she trusted.\n\nBut seeing the name still felt like a knife between her ribs.\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" she said quietly. \"I'll handle it tomorrow.\"\n\nThe announcement wasn't just about land preservation anymore. It was about exposure. About pulling back the curtain. She wanted witnesses. Documentation. The people responsible needed to have nowhere to hide.\n\nTomorrow.\n\nShe closed the folder and stood.\n\nThe French doors led to her private balcony — a small stone outcropping with an old iron railing, overlooking the estate grounds. She'd stood here a thousand times. It was where she came to think, to decompress, to watch the stars the way she'd watched them as a child through the holes in her village cottage's roof.\n\nShe pushed open the doors and stepped outside.\n\nThe night was cool and clear. The stars were thick overhead — more stars than you could ever see from a city, a vast spray of light across the dark.\n\nShe walked to the railing and leaned against it, her weight settling into her forearms, her eyes on the sky.\n\nShe thought about tomorrow. About the announcement. About the look on certain faces when they realized what she knew.\n\nShe thought about betrayal, and trust, and how hard it was to see someone clearly when you wanted so badly to believe they were good.\n\nThe railing was cold and solid beneath her hands.\n\n---\n\nSomewhere in the house, a clock struck two.\n\nChase Matthews was not asleep.\n\nHe was sitting at the small desk by his window, laptop open, cursor blinking on an empty document. He'd been trying to write for hours — notes, observations, the beginning of a structure for the profile — but nothing was coming.\n\nHe kept thinking about dinner. About the way Sofia's voice had changed when she talked about protecting the land. About the look in her eyes.\n\n*Something's going on.*\n\nHe'd written those words in his notebook. He didn't know what they meant.\n\nHe should sleep. Tomorrow was the announcement, and he needed to be sharp.\n\nInstead, he found himself standing. Pulling on his shoes. Moving toward the door.\n\nHe needed to walk. He always needed to walk when his thoughts wouldn't settle.\n\nBut that wasn't the whole truth. The whole truth was that he'd seen Sofia's light go on in her study twenty minutes ago — he'd been watching her window from his room, the way he'd watched her windows every night since he arrived — and he wanted to be closer to her. Even if she didn't know he was there. Even if it was wrong.\n\n*You're doing it again*, a voice in his head warned. *This is how it started with Zoey.*\n\nHe ignored the voice. He always ignored the voice.\n\nThe manor was dark and quiet as he slipped into the corridor. He didn't have a destination — just movement, just the rhythm of footsteps, just the hope that motion might turn into clarity.\n\nHe walked for maybe twenty minutes, wandering through wings he hadn't explored during the day. The estate was larger than it had seemed from outside, full of corners and alcoves and unexpected passages.\n\nIt was in one of these passages that he found himself on a small exterior walkway — a service path connecting two parts of the building. To his left was a low stone wall. To his right was open air, a view of the grounds below, and a balcony.\n\nSofia's balcony. Her \"private thinking spot.\" He knew it immediately — not from the house tour, but from the hours he'd spent mapping the estate, learning which windows were hers, which paths she walked.\n\nAnd she was there.\n\nHe could see her through the French doors, sitting at her desk in the study, reading something. A folder. Her face was lit by a small lamp, and even from this distance, even in profile, she was—\n\n*Stop.*\n\nHe pressed himself against the wall, watching her. His heart was hammering. This was wrong. He knew this was wrong. But he couldn't make himself look away.\n\nShe stood up. Closed the folder. Walked toward the French doors.\n\nChase held his breath.\n\nShe stepped out onto the balcony, into the moonlight, and walked to the railing. She leaned against it, looking up at the stars.\n\nChase studied the balcony. The old ironwork railing, the stone floor, the drop to the terrace below. The service path he was standing on ran along the exterior wall — if he followed it another twenty feet, he'd reach a point where the path and the balcony almost connected. A gap of maybe four feet. Climbable, if you were careful. If you were motivated.\n\nHe wondered how hard it would be. To cross that gap. To climb over the railing. Would the old ironwork hold his weight, or would it give way and send him tumbling to the stones below?\n\nWould it be worth the risk?\n\n*Stop it*, he told himself. *What are you even thinking?*\n\nSofia turned and went back inside. The French doors closed. A moment later, the light in the study went off.\n\nChase stayed where he was, pressed against the wall in the darkness, for a long time.\n\nHe should go back to his room. He should sleep. Tomorrow was the big announcement, and he needed to be sharp, professional, the kind of writer she'd called \"fair.\"\n\nInstead, he walked further along the service path. Closer to the balcony. Just to see. Just to understand the layout.\n\nThe gap was smaller than he'd thought. Three feet, maybe. And the railing looked sturdy enough. Old iron, decorative but solid.\n\nHe could do it. Tonight, even. If he wanted to.\n\nChase stood there for a long time, looking at the balcony."},{id:8,title:"Dawn",subtitle:"The Next Morning",unlockTime:h.getTime()+6048e5,content:"In the small parlor she'd commandeered as a staging area, Ellen Baker was also awake.\n\nThis was not unusual. Ellen was frequently awake at hours when normal people slept. Her husband called it \"productive insomnia.\" Her therapist called it \"something we should probably discuss.\" Ellen called it \"getting things done.\"\n\nTonight, she was reorganizing the breakfast supplies. Again. She'd already done it twice, but the second arrangement hadn't felt right.\n\nShe heard footsteps.\n\nEllen froze, a basket of croissants in her hands.\n\nThe footsteps were soft, careful. Someone trying not to be heard.\n\nShe moved to the doorway of the parlor, peering out into the darkened corridor.\n\nA figure was moving past. A man, carrying something — a bag of some kind. He was heading toward the east wing, walking with quiet purpose.\n\nEllen squinted, but the corridor was too dark to make out features. Just a shape. Just movement.\n\nShe almost called out. Almost said something.\n\nBut then he was gone, disappeared around a corner, and Ellen was left standing in the doorway with her croissants, wondering if she'd actually seen anything worth mentioning or if she was just tired and paranoid.\n\nProbably the latter.\n\nShe went back to reorganizing the breakfast supplies.\n\n---\n\nDawn came slowly to Enchancia Manor.\n\nThe sky shifted from black to gray to pale gold, light creeping across the grounds like something cautious, something that knew what it was about to reveal.\n\nEllen was the first one up, because Ellen was always the first one up. She'd given up on sleep around 5 AM and had spent the intervening hour doing what she always did: preparing. Organizing. Making sure everything was in place.\n\nShe was walking toward the kitchen, mental checklist already running, when she glanced out a window that overlooked the stone terrace below Sofia's balcony.\n\nShe stopped.\n\nThe terrace was never used this early. No one should be—\n\nShe looked again.\n\nThe scream that came out of her was not the polished, controlled sound of a woman who had spent her life managing her presentation. It was raw. Primal. The kind of sound that tore itself from the throat without permission.\n\nIt echoed through the manor, bouncing off old stone walls, shattering the morning quiet.\n\nAnd one by one, the guests of Enchancia Manor woke to discover that everything had changed."}];function
